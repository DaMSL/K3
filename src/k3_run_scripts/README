Usage: 'python run_k3.py -t "path/to/Topology1.csv,path/to/Topology2.csv,..."'

The script will execute the topologies in order with a 10 second break in between topology executions
Typically you want to set up a bunch of k3 triggers and ensure they are running before starting to send
messages to said triggers. You can accomplish this with two topologies; the first will set up your nodes with
triggers and the second will sent a "start" message to begin computation

Topology format:
/Path/To/k3_program.k3
Hostname,peer,param1,role,param3,...     <-- this line is the key
qp1-k3VM,192.168.0.174:40000,"valueforparam1",\"go\","param3value",...

see example in ./NetworkRing/

output will be redirected to the ./output/ folder for each peer
