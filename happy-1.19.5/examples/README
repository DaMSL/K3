These are a few examples of Happy parsers, taken from various sources.
The are intended as illustrations, not as working, complete examples,
as some require functions and datatypes imported from other sources.

Calc.ly	         :  The calculator example from the Happy manual
DavesExample.ly  :  Parses simple lambda expressions to combinators
SimonsExample.ly :  Another lambda expression parser
ErlParser.ly     :  A parser for Erlang
MonadTest.ly     :  Demonstrates use of %monad
LexerTest.ly     :  Demonstrates use of %monad and %lexer
ErrorTest.ly	 :  Demonstrates use of the 'error' token

There are also a few more examples under happy/tests.

A full Haskell 98 parser written using Happy is available from the GHC
CVS repository in fptools/hslibs/hssource.  See
http://www.haskell.org/ghc/ for instructions on how to access the GHC
CVS repository.
