Test case for packing

Grammar allows different (asymmetric) routes for category C, which may get
packed at different times

"make run" to run the test case.

For Hugs, load up Hugs.lhs - it doesn't produce graphs, and has easy entry 
point "test :: String -> IO ()

correct behaviour is packing of ambiguity for all C nodes (for D and E).
