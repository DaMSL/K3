I think it would be nice to have an example of how to have a nice
position tracking monadic parser calling a lexer per token in the
examples directory. I've attached a cut-down parser of mine that does it
well enough for me. The only slight niggle is that parse errors are
reported at the end of the token rather than the start, but that hasn't
bothered me enough to look into fixing it yet.

The cut down parser doesn't use start codes, but I've left the machinery
in to make it easier for people to see how to use them.

Naturally any suggestions for improving it would be gladly received!
