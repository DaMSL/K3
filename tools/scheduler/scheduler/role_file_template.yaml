# You can define multiple roles for an application. Each role equates to a 
#   set of configuration environment settings which will apply to all the peers
#   in the role. To define multiple roles, separate them into different YAML 
#   documents using 3 dashes as the standard YAML separator (---)
---

# name: (required) unique name for the role  
name: role 1

# peers: (required) Total number of peers to run. Peers are allocated on a 1 
#   peer per CPU basis. If you try to assign more peers than available CPUs, 
#   your program will not run 
peers: 3

# peers_per_host: (optional) Specifies the exact # of peers you want running
#   on each host. Again, ensure you allocate on a 1 peer per CPU basis
peers_per_host: 2

# hostmask: (optional) RegEx based filter to specify the hosts on which
#   you want to run your application. By including this field, the dispatcher
#   will ONLY accept offers from hosts whose hostnames match this filter
hostmask: ".*"

# cpu:  (optional) Amount of CPU Cores to allocate per peer. You can allocate
#   less than a core per peer (e.g. 0.25) or more. Be sure not to over allocate 
#   and do your math. The dispatcher will deadlock if you request too much
#   If omitted, the default is 1 core per peer
cpu: 0.1

# mem: (optional) specify the amount of memory PER HOST. Accepted values include: 
#     all:   use all available memory in accepts hosts' offers
#     some:  use "some" memory (the smaller of 25% available or 4GB)
#     <num>: Use exactly <num> GB of memory. Note: offers will be declined
#             if they lack sufficient resources 
#     *If omitted, the default behavior is to use 'all' memory
mem: ".*"


# privileged: (optional) Flag to run the executing docker container in
#   privileged mode. Use with caution!
privileged: False

# k3_globals: (required, if peer_globals are omitted) list of internal K3 Global
#   declarations with their initial value. The 'role' declaration is required. 
#   Any others are specific to your application. Also, note that we have included  
#   an "auto" feature to automatically assign a master peer. By setting 
#   a K3 variable to "auto," the dispatcher will automatically assign the
#   first peer tasked on the first host as the master.
k3_globals:
  role: rows
  master: auto


# peer_globals: (optional) list of internal K3 Global declarations FOR EACH PEER
#   If k3_globals are omitted, you musts explicitly list each k3 global for each 
#   peer as exemplified below. Ensure you have the correct # of peers set in 
#   the peer field above. If you use both the peer_global and the k3_global, the
#   dispatcher will allocated all globals in this list first and then use the
#   k3_globals to set the remaining peers' globals
peer_globals:
  - {role: master, var_x: 1}
  - {role: switch, var_x: 2}
  - {role: timer, var_x: 3}


# envars: (optional) Environment variables to pass to the docker container
envars:
  - {name: LD_PRELOAD, value: /usr/local/lib/libjemalloc.so}

# volumes: (optional) Mounted volumes for the executing docker container.
volumes:
  - {host: /local, container: /local}
  
# k3_data: (optional) Names of data files or paths for allocating input 
#   data into your progam. To use, ensure files are available onto your host 
#   machines and mounted as volumes into the container. If you provide a
#   directory, the dispatcher will allocate input files according to the 
#   given policy. We currently support three policies:
#       replicate -- EVERY peer has the same replicated input data file
#       global -- data files are replicated on all hosts, but should be 
#           globally distributed among all peers on all hosts
#       pinned -- (????) data files are dispersed across all hosts and
#           peers should only input specific data locally
k3_data:
  - {var: dataFiles, path: /local/data/tpch-tiny/lineitem, policy: global}
  - {var: lineitemFiles, path: /local/data/tpch-tiny/lineitem, policy: global}
  - {var: customerFiles, path: /local/data/tpch-tiny/customer, policy: global}  
  - {var: ordersFiles, path: /local/data/tpch-tiny/orders, policy: global}  
  - {var: supplierFiles, path: /local/data/tpch-tiny/supplier, policy: global}  
  - {var: regionFiles, path: /local/data/tpch-tiny/region, policy: replicate}
  - {var: nationFiles, path: /local/data/tpch-tiny/nation, policy: replicate}
