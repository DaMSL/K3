Mosaic script files

--- Main ---
run.rb: main mosaic compilation/deployment script
gen_yaml.py: used by run.rb to create the yamls for each deployment
routing_patterns.py: used by gen_yaml.py to create the specialized direct routing data for mosaic

run_many.rb: deploy whole experiments using run.rb
clean_json.py: convert K3's json output to be more readable (--inplace is best)
create_fpb.rb: convert dbgen's .tbl files to fpb files for mosaic

--- Experiments ---
event_latencies.py: handle event latency graphs
msgcounts.rb: process message counts

--- Old ---
ktrace_schema.sql: a bunch of sql functions for postgres for analyzing the protocol using
                 ktrace data. Haven't used it in a while since the interpreter is better
                 for debugging issues.
demux_agenda.rb: Generate a multiplexed agenda file. Useful for running dbtoaster,
                 since dbtoaster can't understand mosaic's binary format.
mk_agenda.rb:    Similar role as above
mk_deletion_agenda.k3: Somehow does the same thing
